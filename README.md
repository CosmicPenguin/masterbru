masterbru
=========

Masterbru is the working title for a beer brewery simulation game for Android
(and others?) The player manages a brewery from a small nano-brewery all the
way up to national exposure.  The brewer must purchase equipment, gain fans
(drinkers) and upgrade the brewery from a local to regional to national
presence.

The game is built using the excellent godot engine (http://http://www.godotengine.org).

More gameplay details to come as I figure them out.
